## Get started

```bash
npm i
npm run dev
```

## Link
[next-js-13-dark-mode.vercel.app/](https://next-js-13-dark-mode.vercel.app/)

## Required packages 
`next-themes` (https://www.npmjs.com/package/next-themes)

## Notice

There's still a small bug in this dark mode button. At the very first time, when you click on the dark mode button, it just adds the "theme" to local storage, but not directly changes to the dark mode theme. From the second click, it works smoothly.
